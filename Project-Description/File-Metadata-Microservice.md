##API Project: File Metadata Microservice

User Stories:
1. I can submit a form object that includes a file upload.
1. The from file input field has the "name" attribute set to "upfile". We rely on this in testing.
1. When I submit something, I will receive the file name, and size in bytes within the JSON response.
